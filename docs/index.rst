Falcon Middleware: SQLAlchemy Integration
=========================================

The ``falcon-sqla`` package provides a middleware component for managing
`SQLAlchemy sessions <https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/orm/session_api.html#Session>`_.
The manager component can also serve as a base building block or a recipe for
more complex use cases, such as applications leveraging multiple database
binds.
